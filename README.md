Q1 : Given an array having both positive and negative integers.Find length of the largest subarray with sum 0.
    
    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is no subarray with 0 sum

    Input: arr[] = {15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23}
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The longest sub-array with elements summing up-to 0 is {-2, 2, -8, 1, 7}

Q5:  Array of product except self: **https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/**

Q6:  Sort 0,1 and 2 inside array: **https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/**

Q7:  First Missing positive: **https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/description/**

**Note:** What is inplace: you should not use another array, do it in same array
Relative order: the order of the elements should remain same:

For example: [0,1,0,3,12] â€”-> [1,3,12,0,0] (the order of 1,3 and 12 is same as in initial array)
